Steps:
Define Variables and Datatypes:

Use variables to store the student's name (String), age (int), and grades (float or double).
Calculate the average grade using arithmetic operations.
Input:

Take input for the student's name, age, and grades in 3 subjects (e.g., Math, Science, English).
Use Scanner class for input.
Processing:

Calculate the average grade.
Determine the grade classification based on the average.
Output:

Display the student's name, age, grades, average grade, and classification.
